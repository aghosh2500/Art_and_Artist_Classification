# Art_and_Artist_Classification
## About this project

I'm Advait Ghosh, a high schooler from the Bay Area. This project uses deep learning models to classify art and artists, addressing a critical issue facing the creative community today. The artist community has experienced tremendous stress in recent years, with ongoing lawsuits highlighting the challenges they face in protecting their work and intellectual property. 

Beyond the broader impact, this project holds personal significance for me, as I've been making art my whole life, which has given me a deep appreciation for the struggles artists face. This personal connection, combined with the urgent need to develop tools to protect and attribute artistic work, motivated me to tackle this problem using machine learning.
